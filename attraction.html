  <p id="one">Wondering what to visit in Korea ?</p>
  <p  id="two" >I'll be your guide!</p>
  <p id="three">Among popular tourist attractions in South Korea, modern values are often projected onto historic cultural heritage, or conversely, traditional elements are added to modern spaces. They serve not only as precious cultural heritage and vibrant living spaces for Koreans but also as a starting point for foreigners to visit Korea.</p>

<h2 class="animation">1. Hankok Village</h2>
<img src="images/hankok.jpeg">
  <p class="animation">Hanok villages, which can be found in a few places in Seoul and around Korea, are living museums. They're restored and preserved ancient neighborhoods, some in their original location (like Bukchon) and some re-created with hanoks (traditional Korean homes) moved from elsewhere. They give visitors an opportunity to not only experience what it was like to live in a hanok, but also what it was like to live in Korea 600 years ago.
You can experience the tiny, narrow streets and also explore Korean culture, as many of the hanoks are museums or offer cultural demonstrations. Many are private homes, and some offer accommodations. That's what makes these village areas so special; they are true living history because many of the homes are privately owned and occupied by real local residents.
Bukchon Hanok Village is a popular place to explore, as it's right in central Seoul, in the area between the Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Changdeokgung Palace.</p>
  <h2 class="animation">2. Changdeokgung Palace</h2>
  <img src="images/palace.jpeg">
  <p class="animation">Of the five grand palaces built by the Joseon Dyantasy in the 15th century around Seoul, Changdeokgung Palace was always the preferred royal residence. It's where the king and royal family lived their daily lives.The palace isn't just a single building, it's a complex of buildings, and each served a different purpose. Some are accommodations, some are libraries, dining rooms, and meeting rooms, among other uses. Be sure to spend some time in the 78-acre Huwon, or palace garden, located behind the palace. It's filled with pathways, green spaces, pagodas, streams, and lakes.<br>Address: 99 Yulgok-ro, Waryong-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea

  <h2 class="animation">3. Gwanghwamun Square</h2>
  <img src="images/square.jpeg">
  <p class="animation">Gwanghwamun Square is a public square with over 600 years of history. Located at the center of Sejong-ro Road, it focuses on people first, cars later. With Gyeongbokgung Palace and Bugaksan Mountain in the background, the square restored the past, serving as a cultural and historical space. Various statues and structures were reproduced to bring back the historical look.</p>
  <h2 class="animation">4. Gamcheon Culture Village</h2>
  <img src="images/busan.jpeg">
  <p class="animation">Colorful, terraced houses that look seaward characterize Gamcheon Cultural Village in Busan. Before 2009, Gamcheon was a slum; home to refugees from the Korean War. However, various government agencies undertook an initiative to redevelop the area as a tourist attraction and artistic hub. As such, the city received funding to beautify their town. Artists flocked to the area and now art lives around every corner, whether it’s outdoor statues or street art.<br>Today, the best way to experience the city is simply to lose yourself in the colorful alleyways of this unique town.

  <h2 class="animation">5. N Seoul Tower</h2>
  <img src="images/tower.jpeg">
  <p class="animation">Yes, everyone visiting Seoul should go up in the city's iconic observation tower. Its position almost on top of a mountain, plus the height of the tower itself, gets you almost 500 meters above sea level and the city below. But leave some time to explore the surrounding mountain area. The tower is near the top of Mount Namsan, and the entire area is Namsan Park, which is run by the city. There are miles of hiking trails to explore, all within a few minutes of downtown Seoul.
The top levels of the N Seoul Tower include indoor and outdoor observation areas and restaurants. The exterior of the tower is covered in LED lighting, which is illuminated each night in seasonal light shows.
There's a cable car that takes you from the city (near Myeongdong) to the tower's base area. You can then hike from here. After climbing the mountain and riding on the cable car, leave time to explore the Namsan Hanok Village. These preserved historic villages, which are located all over Seoul and Korea, are re-creations of ancient Korean neighborhoods. This village includes five restored hanoks or traditional Korean homes.<br>
Address: 105 Namsangongwon-gil, Yongsan 2(i)ga-dong, Yongsan-gu, Seoul</p>
  <h2 class="animation">6. Ganghwado Island</h2>
  <img src="images/island.jpeg">
  <p class="animation">Located in the West Sea, Ganghwado Island is brimming with history. It has been occupied since prehistoric times and even enjoyed a period when it was the capital of Korea in the 13th century. In the 19th century, the island was used strategically to defend against the French and Japanese.
Aside from historical sites, Ganghwado Island offers impressive scenery, with several trails leading around the island; including Manisan Mountain with its expansive sea views. Only a short 90 minutes from Seoul, the island is close to the North Korean border and connected to the mainland via a bridge, so it is very accessible.</p>
  <h2 class="animation">7. Jindo Sea Parting</h2>
  <img src="images/jindo.jpeg">
  <p class="animation">South Korea has its own modern version of the famous biblical story of Moses. Every year, visitors from around the world flock to Jindo to witness this natural phenomenon of the ‘sea parting’.However, it is not as magical as it might first appear; the natural bridge is the result of a yearly accumulation of pebbles and sand which have collected due to the tide. In total, the sea parting is 2.8 kilometers long, and at low tide, 40-60 meters wide. A number of exciting exhibitions and programs take place for the duration of the festival; including parades and cultural events.</p>
  <h2 class="animation">8. Boseong Tea Fields</h2>
  <img src="images/boseong.jpeg">
  <p class="animation">The beautiful, rolling green hills of Boseong Tea Fields are the only fields of their kind open in Korea, and are just begging for a photo. There are many walking trails and viewing points where you can take in the beauty of the verdant gardens and watch the skilled workers selecting the best tea leaves. Tea is an integral part of Korean culture and you can experience a traditional Korean tea ceremony while you are here. It is a great way to dive into learning about Korean culture and get a chance to sample some fresh tea too.<br>Before you leave, don’t forget to check out the beautiful bamboo forest on the outskirts of the fields.</p>
